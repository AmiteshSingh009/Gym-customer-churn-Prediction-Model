# Gym-customer-churn-Prediction-Model
This project aims to predict gym member churn — identifying customers who are likely to cancel their memberships — using machine learning techniques. By leveraging customer behavior data such as attendance, membership duration, and spending habits, the model helps gyms make data-driven decisions to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.
